# R Bootcamp Code Challenge

## The Challenge

For each number from 1 to 100, if the number is divisible by 3 print "fizz", if the number is divisible by 5 print "buzz", if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 print "fizzbuzz" and if the number is not divisible by 3 or 5 print the number itself.

```{r}

```

## Step by Step
1. How do you print the numbers 1 to 100?
```{r}

```
2. How do you check if a number is divisble by 3? By 5? By 3 and 5?
```{r}

```
3. How can you print something conditionally?
> Use an `if` loop!
```{r}

```
4. What if you have multiple cases?
> Use an `else if` loop!
```{r}

```

5. Can you solve this problem without any loops?
```{r}

```
