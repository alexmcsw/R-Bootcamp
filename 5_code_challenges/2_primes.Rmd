# R Bootcamp Code Challenge

## The Challenge

Print all prime numbers from 1 to 100.

```{r}

```

## Step by Step
1. How do you print the numbers 1 to 100?
```{r}

```
2. How do you check if a number is prime?
> A number p is prime if it's only divisors are 1 and p.
> Equivalently you can check that there are no divisors between 2 and the nearest integer to the squareroot of p.
```{r}

```
3. How can you print something conditionally?
> Use an `if` loop!
```{r}

```

5. Can you find a more efficient solution?
> You may want to read up on prime sieves!
```{r}

```
