# R Bootcamp Code Challenge

## The Challenge

Write a script to sum an arbitrary number of integers together.

```{r}

```

## Step by Step

1. How do you add two numbers together?

```{r}

```

2. How do you add multiple numbers together?

```{r}

```

3. How can the user specify the numbers to be added?

> Hint: Use the `readline` function: <https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/readline>

```{r}

```

4. What if the user inputs something other than an integer?

> Hint: use the `type()` function to check the inputs

```{r}

```

5. Can you tidy up your previous work into a single function?

> Hint: Remember the function should take user input integers as an input and output a single integer value in the end

```{r}

```

6. Can you find a creative way to sum numbers without using standard methods (ie. sum() or +)?

```{r}

```
