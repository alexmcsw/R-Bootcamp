# R Bootcamp

## Day 3

You should now have some knowledge of visualizations in R.

In the project work section of day 3 you should answer the following questions:

1. Did everyone complete their work from day 2? The team lead should reassign work as needed to ensure it is completed in time.

2. Do you need to complete any more analysis? As a team, determine if it is realistic and assign as appropriate.

3. What types of visualizations would you like to include in your report? Determine who will work on which visualizations.
>You may wish to create a surplus of visualizations and then select the best for inclusion in the final report.

Enter the answers to these questions as a team in the shared doc.
