# Project Proposal

## Description

Over the course of the bootcamp, you and your team will be working on a sample project to practice techniques learned in the tutorials, use Gitlab for version control and project management, and to collaboratively develop code.

## The Project

You are a newly formed Statistics Canada team to help steer the ship away from the SAS-shaped iceberg we are currently on track to hit. As we are all aware, the agency's most important division, the Canadian Hub for Environment, Ecological Strategy & Innovation (CHEESI), must be the first into the lifeboat. You will be working on re-imagining and updating our dairy statistics using R.

Your goal is to output a report detailing trends in dairy stock, costs, and possible future directions. Your report should contain visualizations as well as headlines to present to management. The exact direction you take with the project and what you choose to produce is up to you. That being said, you should try to answer (some of) the following in your report:

1. Determine the most significant dairy stock to the Canadian economy.
2. Identify a time when the Canadian Dairy market seemed to struggle in the past.
3. Determine if dairy consumers' habits have changed over time.
4. Determine what factors may be driving seasonal/annual/other trends in dairy stock.

Answers to each of these questions should be supported by the data!

### The Data

You can explore the [Government of Canada Open Data Portal](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data) and the [Statcan Open Data Portal](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data?MM=1#tables) for inspiration. Here are some datasets that may be of interest:

- [Production of selected dairy products](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3210011201)
- [Dairy products](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/8763e257-f9a5-485f-b703-ea17d571419d)
- [Domestic and per capita disappearence of cheese products](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/e937f321-9046-4abf-90f0-7a60887b761d)
- [Commercial sales of milk and cream](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3210011401)

### Your Tasks

We recommend in the early days of the bootcamp that each participant explore the data in the direction of their interest and according to their skill level. Midway through the bootcamp we will have a project update session to see where everyone is at and help narrow down the focus of the project.

Using techniques learned during the workshops you should try to answer the above questions by:

1. Reading in and preparing your data
2. Analyzing/processing your data
3. Choosing and creating the most effective visualizations and or methods for sharing your findings
4. Creating a presentation to share your work with a superior or a nontechnical audience

## Expectations

This bootcamp is for you and it is up to you to participate and learn. You are responsible for your output and you are expected to present your progress and findings in a **final presentation** with your group and upper management. We are here to help and your manager and/or workshop organizers should be made aware of issues, e.g., time conflicts, **as soon as possible**.
