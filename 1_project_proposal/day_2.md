# R Bootcamp

## Day 2

You should now have some knowledge of Git branches and groups.

1. The designated team lead should create a subgroup for your team in Gitlab and add each member to it with the appropriate permissions.
2. The team lead (or someone they identify) should create a public repository for your final project.
3. Each team member should attempt to create a branch on the main repository and reach out to the team lead or bootcamp organizers for assistance during office hours.

In the project work section of day 2 you should answer the following questions:

1. Of the datasets selected last day, which will actually be helpful?

2. What further analysis needs to be done and who will do it? Complete this analysis for day 3 if possible.

3. Are you missing any knowledge or tools to complete your desired analysis?

Enter the answers to these questions as a team in the shared doc.
