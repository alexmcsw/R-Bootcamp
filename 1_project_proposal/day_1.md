# R Bootcamp

## Day 1

In the project work section of day 1 you should answer the following questions:


1. What research question(s) do we hope to answer?

> If you'd like to answer a different question that is not in the recommended list in the README, that is fine but please keep the recommended questions in mind as a back up, just in case!


2. Which datasets have we identified to help answer the above question(s)?

3. Who in the team will ensure we stay on track? Ideally, this person should be quite comfortable with Git.

4. What tasks will each team member do before day 2?
> We suggest each member completes some exploratory analysis of a particular dataset so you can cover the most ground.

Enter the answers to these questions as a team in the shared doc.
