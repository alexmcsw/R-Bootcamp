# R tutorials
In this folder you will find a variety of Rmarkdown files with tutorials and exercises covering industry-standard methods and best practices for data analysis in R. We recommend you follow the lessons in order but feel free to move ahead if you are already familiar with a topic.

## Prerequisites
This tutorial is intended for those who have completed introductory R training, Git training, and are participating with their team in a bootcamp. You should already be familiar and comfortable with the following concepts:

- RStudio
- Packages
- Version Control

If you are struggling with any of the above concepts do not hesitate to reach out but ensure you remain respectful of the instructor's time.

## Introduction
Rmarkdown files consist of blocks or chunks of code written in R and text written in markdown (this document is written in pure markdown). You can run the code chunk by chunk or by knitting the entire document at once.

Below is how the chunks appear in an Rmarkdown file. In this chunk we load some packages. Anything behind a "#" symbol is "commented code" and will be ignored by the compiler. Note that you can't actually run this code since we are in a pure markdown file.
```r
# Load libraries
library(cansim) # read in CODR/NDM tables
library(dplyr) # allows for data manipulation
library(tidyr) # allows for shaping the data
library(plotly) # for creating plots
library(lubridate) # for manipulating date-time objects
```

## The Tutorials

The tutorials in this folder will take you through the basics of
1. reading in data
2. cleaning and filtering
3. processing and basic analysis
4. visualizations
5. generating outputs

You are expected to participate in all tutorial sessions and try out the exercises in real time.
