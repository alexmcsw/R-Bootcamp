# R Bootcamp Tutorial

## Programming Logic (Optional)

In this lesson, we will cover:

1. Objects and Variables
2. Data types
3. Loops


## Objects and Variables
R is an object-oriented programming language. That means that it allows you to store single values (think a number or text) as a “variable.” 

This is analogous to putting an object in a box and labeling that box. 

 You can use a caret and dash to assign an object a value. For example:
 
```{r}
surveys <- 20 
```

`print` will allow you to see what is stored in a variable. 

```{r}
print(surveys)
```

## Data Types

There are different data types in programming languages. Different types of data are treated differently by R and its functions. In R, the simplest are:

* Character: Comprised of text with quotations around it. Ex: “red”
* Numeric: Comprised of numbers
* Logical: TRUE or FALSE

Try the following:

```{r}
class(surveys)
```

What type of variable is `surveys`?

## Loops

One great thing about computers is that they don't mind completing repetitive tasks that might not be so fun for a human, leading to manual errors and boredom. *Loops* are iterative processes that apply instructions over a predefined set of data. 

*For loops* are some of the most common and useful types of loops in R. Take a look at this code:

```{r}

for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i)
}

```
The loop defines a vector (1:5), which contains all of the numbers from 1 to 5. On each iteration of the loop, i represents one of these numbers. Then, the loop is instructed to print each i. Run the code and see what it produces! What would changing the vector's length do?
